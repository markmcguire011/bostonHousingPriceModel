# Boston Housing Price Model

In this project I wanted to find some way to predict housing prices for a certain area.
I chose to analyze Boston because the data set I found didn't have any nulls and all
its attributes were numerical values.

I utilized pandas, numpy, matplot, seaborn, and scikit-learn for this project and chose to
apply a linear regression model.
