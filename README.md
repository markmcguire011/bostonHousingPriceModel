# Boston Housing Price Model

## Overview

In this project I wanted to find some way to predict housing prices for a certain area. I chose to analyze Boston because the data set I found was extremely complete and well rounded with no null values.

I utilized pandas, numpy, matplot, seaborn, and scikit-learn for this project.

## Personal Learning Objectives

These were my goals going into this project:

- Be able to explore large data sets with big data libraries like pandas and matplot.
- Make educated attriute and feature decisions based on heat maps and graphs procured through data analysis.
- Practice implementing linear regression models as a first step in the AI and ML space
- Expand upon foundational techniques and integrate more complex modelling strategies and algorithims

## Outcome and Reflection

At first I applied a linear regression model and came up with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.74, so I decided to explore and attempt incorporating polynomial features in order to improve this metric. This did end up yielding much better accuracy with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.86. 

I still wanted to try and explore different modeling techiniques so I decided to go ahead with the Random Forest algorithim. This algorithim performed even beter yielding an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.89.

This project served as a good introduction to the data science and modelling field for me, and I gained a lot of good experience working with the standard ML libraries. Reading through scitkit_learn documentation and figuring out how to interpret the various graphs and tables generated in the data processing stage has helped me get a firmer grasp on ML fundamentals. Fundamentals that I can now apply to bigger and more complex projects.
